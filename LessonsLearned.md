# For Loops


## Break Statement

Use "break" in for loops, if you want to test multiple conditions, but only want one output. For example.
See Day8Exercise2 on PrimeNumberChecker for example.


## Assigning variables in for loops


Make sure to reference the variable before the loop, to initialize it, and after the loop, so that your 
assignment is actually used somewhere.




# Useful modules/functions


##  from os import system  system('clear') or system('cls')
